# Cart Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The shopping cart was showing pre-filled items (2 laptops and 1 headphone) for all users due to:

1. **Global localStorage cart**: Cart data was stored with a generic 'cart' key, not user-specific
2. **No cart cleanup on login**: Previous user's cart data remained when new users logged in
3. **Incorrect data prioritization**: Frontend prioritized localStorage over backend data
4. **No session isolation**: Cart data was shared between different user sessions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Authentication-Based Cart Clearing
- **Login**: Cart data is automatically cleared when a new user logs in
- **Logout**: Cart data is cleared when user logs out
- **App Start**: Cart data is cleared if no valid authentication token exists

### 2. Backend-First Data Strategy
- **CartModal**: Now fetches from backend first, uses localStorage only as fallback
- **CheckoutModal**: Same backend-first approach
- **Add to Cart**: Prioritizes backend operations, syncs to localStorage
- **Remove from Cart**: Backend-first removal with localStorage sync

### 3. Enhanced Authentication Handling
- **Token Management**: Setting/removing tokens automatically clears user-specific data
- **API Error Handling**: 401/403 responses automatically clear invalid tokens and cart data
- **Session Validation**: Invalid sessions trigger automatic cleanup

### 4. Improved Data Synchronization
- **Consistent Flow**: Backend → localStorage (not the reverse)
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallback to localStorage if backend fails
- **State Management**: Proper cleanup between user sessions

## Files Modified

1. **Frontend/src/utils/api.js**
   - Enhanced auth object with clearUserData functionality
   - Added 401/403 error handling in apiRequest
   - Automatic cart cleanup on token management

2. **Frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx**
   - Cart cleanup on successful login

3. **Frontend/src/pages/Items.jsx**
   - Simplified logout with automatic cleanup
   - Improved add-to-cart error handling

4. **Frontend/src/components/CartModal.jsx**
   - Backend-first data fetching
   - Improved delete functionality
   - Removed unnecessary clearDeletedItems function

5. **Frontend/src/components/CheckoutModal.jsx**
   - Backend-first data fetching for checkout

6. **Frontend/src/App.jsx**
   - Added authentication check and cleanup on app start

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### User A logs in:
- ✅ Sees empty cart initially
- ✅ Can add items to cart
- ✅ Cart persists during session
- ✅ Can remove items successfully

### User A logs out, User B logs in:
- ✅ User B sees empty cart (not User A's items)
- ✅ User B can create their own cart
- ✅ No interference between user sessions

### Data Consistency:
- ✅ Backend is source of truth
- ✅ localStorage used only for UI performance
- ✅ Proper sync between backend and frontend
- ✅ Graceful error handling

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Multi-user Test**: Login with different users and verify cart isolation
2. **Session Test**: Logout and login to verify cart cleanup
3. **Browser Test**: Clear browser storage and verify clean state
4. **Network Test**: Test with poor network to verify fallback behavior
5. **Token Expiry**: Test with expired tokens to verify automatic cleanup

The fix ensures proper user-cart association and eliminates the pre-filled cart issue.
