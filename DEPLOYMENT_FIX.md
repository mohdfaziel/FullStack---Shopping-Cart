# Deployment Fix for Cart Issue

## Problem Identified
The deployed version of the backend uses a different implementation (`api/index.go`) that had **hardcoded demo cart items**:
- 2 Laptops 
- 1 Headphones

This caused ALL users to see these pre-filled items regardless of their actual cart state.

## Root Cause
The deployed backend in `Backend/api/index.go` line 256-284 contained:
```go
// Default demo cart with a couple of items for demonstration
demoCart = []map[string]interface{}{
    {
        "id": 1, "item_id": 1, "quantity": 2,
        "item": {"id": 1, "name": "Laptop", ...}
    },
    {
        "id": 2, "item_id": 3, "quantity": 1, 
        "item": {"id": 3, "name": "Headphones", ...}
    },
}
```

## Fix Applied
Replaced the hardcoded demo cart with an empty cart:
```go
} else {
    // Start with an empty cart for new users - no demo items
    demoCart = []map[string]interface{}{}
}
```

## Deployment Instructions

### For Vercel Backend:
```bash
cd Backend
vercel --prod
```

### For Vercel Frontend:
```bash
cd Frontend
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

## Testing After Deployment
1. **Clear browser cache and localStorage**
2. **Login with any user**
3. **Cart should be completely empty**
4. **Add items - only user-added items should appear**
5. **Delete items - should work properly**
6. **Logout/Login - cart should remain user-specific**

## Why This Wasn't an Issue Locally
- Local development uses `main.go` with SQLite database
- Deployed version uses `api/index.go` with in-memory storage
- Only the deployed version had hardcoded demo items

## Expected Behavior After Fix
✅ New users start with empty cart
✅ Cart shows only user-added items  
✅ Items can be deleted properly
✅ No cart data bleeding between users
✅ Consistent behavior between local and deployed versions
